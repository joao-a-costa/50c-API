# Sage50c-API (Forked)

## Overview
This repository is a fork of the [Sage Portugal 50c-API](https://github.com/sage-portugal/50c-API), providing tools and extensibility for Sage 50c. The project aims to enhance the API by resolving outstanding issues and introducing new features to better serve the community.

## Motivation for the Fork
The original repository was unresponsive to issues and pull requests. To address the needs of developers relying on this API, I decided to create this fork, actively maintain it, and implement improvements based on user feedback and requirements.

## Features
- Seamless integration with Sage 50c.
- Enhanced API examples for easier onboarding.
- Bug fixes and improvements over the original project.
- Modular structure for better extensibility.
- Support for .NET Core and modern development practices.
